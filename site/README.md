## Apache Arrow Website

### Development instructions

If you are planning to publish the website, you must first clone the arrow-site
git repository:

```shell
git clone --branch=asf-site https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/arrow-site.git asf-site
```

Now, with Ruby >= 2.1 installed, run:

```shell
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install

# This imports the format Markdown documents so they will be rendered
scripts/sync_format_docs.sh

bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Publishing

After following the above instructions the base `site/` directory, run:

```shell
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
rsync -r build/ asf-site/
cd asf-site
git status
```

Now `git add` any new files, then commit everything, and push:

```
git push
```

### Updating Code Documentation

#### Java

```
cd ../java
mvn install
mvn site
rsync -r target/site/apidocs/ ../site/asf-site/docs/java/
```

#### C++

```
cd ../cpp/apidoc
doxygen Doxyfile
rsync -r html/ ../../site/asf-site/docs/cpp
```

#### Python

First, build PyArrow with all optional extensions (Apache Parquet).

```
cd ../python
python setup.py build_ext --inplace --with-parquet --with-plasma
python setup.py build_sphinx -s doc/source
rsync -r doc/_build/html/ ../site/asf-site/docs/python/
```

#### C (GLib)

First, build Apache Arrow C++ and Apache Arrow GLib.

```
mkdir -p ../cpp/build
cd ../cpp/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
make
cd ../../c_glib
./autogen.sh
./configure \
  --with-arrow-cpp-build-dir=$PWD/../cpp/build \
  --with-arrow-cpp-build-type=debug \
  --enable-gtk-doc
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/../cpp/build/debug make GTK_DOC_V_XREF=": "
rsync -r doc/reference/html/ ../site/asf-site/docs/c_glib/
```

Then add/commit/push from the site/asf-site git checkout.
