Apache Arrow (Python)
=====================

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It
specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat
and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern
hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming
messaging and interprocess communication.

The Arrow Python bindings have first-class integration with NumPy, pandas, and
built-in Python objects.

This is the documentation of the Python API of Apache Arrow. For more details
on the format and other language bindings see
`the main page for Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org/>`_. Here will we only
detail the usage of the Python API for Arrow and the leaf libraries that add
additional functionality such as reading Apache Parquet files into Arrow
structures.
