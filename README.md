# Siren fork of Arrow

- The property `drill.enable_unsafe_memory_access` is prefixed with `siren` and its default value is set to `true`.
- The Siren's fork of netty is used.

## Build

To build the memory bundle:

```sh
$ cd java
$ mvn clean package -pl memory
```

To deploy:

```sh
$ mvn deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true -pl memory -P artifactory -Dartifactory_username=<USERNAME> -Dartifactory_password=<PASSWORD>
```

### Powering Columnar In-Memory Analytics

Arrow is a set of technologies that enable big-data systems to process and move data fast.

Initial implementations include:

 - [The Arrow Format](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/format)
 - [C++ implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp)
 - [Java implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/java)
 - [JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/js)
 - [Python interface to C++ libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/python)

Arrow is an [Apache Software Foundation](www.apache.org) project. Learn more at
[arrow.apache.org](http://arrow.apache.org).

### What's in the Arrow libraries?

The reference Arrow implementations contain a number of distinct software
components:

- Columnar vector and table-like containers (similar to data frames) supporting
  flat or nested types
- Fast, language agnostic metadata messaging layer (using Google's Flatbuffers
  library)
- Reference-counted off-heap buffer memory management, for zero-copy memory
  sharing and handling memory-mapped files
- Low-overhead IO interfaces to files on disk, HDFS (C++ only)
- Self-describing binary wire formats (streaming and batch/file-like) for
  remote procedure calls (RPC) and
  interprocess communication (IPC)
- Integration tests for verifying binary compatibility between the
  implementations (e.g. sending data from Java to C++)
- Conversions to and from other in-memory data structures (e.g. Python's pandas
  library)

### Getting involved

Even if you do not plan to contribute to Apache Arrow itself or Arrow
integrations in other projects, we'd be happy to have you involved:

- Join the mailing list: send an email to
  [dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org][1]. Share your ideas and use cases for the
  project.
- [Follow our activity on JIRA][3]
- [Learn the format][2]
- Contribute code to one of the reference implementations

### How to Contribute

We prefer to receive contributions in the form of GitHub pull requests. Please
send pull requests against the [github.com/apache/arrow][4] repository.

If you are looking for some ideas on what to contribute, check out the [JIRA
issues][3] for the Apache Arrow project. Comment on the issue and/or contact
[dev@arrow.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/arrow-dev/)
with your questions and ideas.

If you’d like to report a bug but don’t have time to fix it, you can still post
it on JIRA, or email the mailing list
[dev@arrow.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/arrow-dev/)

To contribute a patch:

1. Break your work into small, single-purpose patches if possible. It’s much
harder to merge in a large change with a lot of disjoint features.
2. Create a JIRA for your patch on the [Arrow Project
JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW).
3. Submit the patch as a GitHub pull request against the master branch. For a
tutorial, see the GitHub guides on forking a repo and sending a pull
request. Prefix your pull request name with the JIRA name (ex:
https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/240).
4. Make sure that your code passes the unit tests. You can find instructions
how to run the unit tests for each Arrow component in its respective README
file.
5. Add new unit tests for your code.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!
